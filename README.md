# ShortestPathAlgorithm

Completes Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman–Ford algorithm and Floyd–Warshall algorithm  to solve the shortest path algorithm.

Graph Filename | Output File | Source Vector

Graph Filename in csv form giving the distance between each vertex in table form, e.g

0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0

4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 0

0, 8, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2

0, 0, 7, 0, 9, 14, 0, 0, 0

0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0

0, 0, 4, 14, 10, 0, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 6
8, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7

0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 0

Prints out the distance to each vertex with timing of each algorithm.
